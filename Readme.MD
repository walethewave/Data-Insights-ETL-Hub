# Data-Insights-ETL-Hub

## Overview:
# This application provides functionalities for managing data stored in a PostgreSQL database and making predictions based on the data using Python scripts.

## Installation:
# 1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
# 2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Configuration:
# Before running the scripts, ensure to configure the `config.py` file with your PostgreSQL database credentials:
# ```python
# user = " default username is [postgres] "
# password = " your password here "
# host = " localhost or 127.0.0.1 "
# port = " default port is [5432] "
# ```

## Scripts:
# 1. `csv_to_postgres.py`:
#    This script allows you to import CSV data into your PostgreSQL database.

### Usage:
# Run the script using the following command:

# ```bash
# python3 csv_to_postgres.py
# ```
# Follow the prompts and choose an option:
# - Option 1: Import data from CSV to PostgreSQL.
# - Option 2: Exit the script.

# 2. `prediction_script.py`:
#    This script enables you to make predictions based on the data stored in the PostgreSQL database.

### Usage:
# Run the script using the following command:

# ```bash
# python3 prediction_script.py
# ```
# Follow the prompts and choose an option:
# - Option 1: Make predictions based on the data.
# - Option 2: Exit the script.

## Dependencies:
# - Python 3.x
# - PostgreSQL 16
